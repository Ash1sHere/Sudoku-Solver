# Sudoku-Solver

The Sudoku Solver is a Python-based application that solves any given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter, allowing users to input a Sudoku puzzle into a 9x9 grid. To use the solver, simply run the Python script, input the puzzle by typing numbers (leave empty cells blank), and click the “Solve” button to get the solution. If the puzzle is unsolvable, a message will appear. To run the program, make sure you have Python installed along with the tkinter library (which usually comes pre-installed with Python). Execute the script, and the GUI will open for you to interact with the puzzle.
